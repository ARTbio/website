Analysing molecular data in translational medicine involves a multitude of computational steps. Here, we introduce the basics of how to design and run these steps within Galaxy, a free and easy-to-use web platform that enables users to connect bioinformatics tools into a workflow without any prior programming expertise.

This course consists of two parts. Part 1 will let you get familiar with Galaxy; it will introduce some bioinformatics workflows used for RNAseq, variant detection and metagenomics; and how to easily connect different computational steps in Galaxy. Part 2 will focus on how to teach bioinformatics with Galaxy and to design bioinformatics courses using Galaxy. Participants can register for both parts separately.
This course is also interspersed with a few keynotes, from recognised researchers in the fields of Biomedicine, Bioinformatics education and Galaxy workflows. The confirmed speakers include Jaap Heringa, who is the scientific director of the Netherlands Bioinformatics Centre; and Björn Grüning, who is the leader of Galaxy training network, also actively involved in Bioconda.


### TARGET AUDIENCE

1. Biomedical & translational medicine researchers/students who are keen on bioinformatics
2. educators in the “bio” domain who would like to start using Galaxy in their courses as an introduction to Bioinformatics.

### PREREQUISITE KNOWLEDGE

The attendees of Part I are assumed to have the basic knowledge of biomedicine (molecular biology and genomics) and be interested in analysing patient derived sequencing data. The attendees of Part II are assumed to have some teaching experience in bioinformatics.

### EXPENSE

Course participation is free of charge.
A workshop dinner will be organized on Thursday  (at participants’ own expenses)

The course consists of six modules, as the table above shows, covering a list of topics as follows:

- Introduction to Galaxy. Run bioinformatics tools and workflows in Galaxy without the need for any programming expertise.
- Reference-based RNA-Seq data analysis
- Module detection in differential gene expression in meta transcriptomics samples.
- Microbiota Analysis: 16S rRNA sequencing analysis in Galaxy
- How to teach bioinformatics workflows.
- Galaxy setup for teaching and training material development.

Note: The course is held in a computer classroom, so you don’t need to bring your own laptop.

We will accept a maximum of 30 participants. Registration will be open shortly.
