# Welcome to **Galaxy Proteomics Europe**

*This European Galaxy branches off from the main [usegalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu){:target="_blank"} server and focuses on one specific domain: Proteomics.*

**Galaxy Proteomics** is a multiple 'omics' data analysis platform with particular emphasis on mass spectrometry-based proteomics. It is hosted by GalaxyEU and maintained by the [GalaxyP team](http://galaxyp.org){:target="_blank"} from the University of Minnesota, MN, USA.
