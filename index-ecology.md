## Tools?



## Tutorials

We are passionate about training. So we are working in close collaboration with the [Galaxy Training Network (GTN)](https://galaxyproject.org/teach/gtn/){:target="_blank"} to develop training materials of data analyses based on Galaxy {% cite batut2017community %}. These materials hosted on the GTN GitHub repository are available online at [https://training.galaxyproject.org](https://training.galaxyproject.org){:target="_blank"}.

We then developed [several tutorials](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/ecology/){:target="_blank"} and more will come:
