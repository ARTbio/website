# Get started

Are you new to Galaxy, or returning after a long time, and looking for help to get started? Take [a guided tour](https://cheminformatics.usegalaxy.eu/tours/core.galaxy_ui){:target="_blank"} through Galaxy's user interface.

Want to learn about computational chemistry? Check our [tutorials](#tutorials) or take one of our guided tour:

Check also the standard but customizable [workflows](#workflows) available there.

# Tools

Several tools are integrated in this custom Galaxy instance. They were chosen for their use in exploitation of chemical data:

- **General tools**
    - **Data retrieval**: PubChem downloader
    - **Conversion**:
    - **Fingerprint tools**:
- **MD tools**
    - **Quality control**:
- **Docking tools**

# Workflows

To orchestrate tools and help users with their analyses, several workflows are available. They formally orchestrate tools in a defined order and with defined parameters, but they are customizable (tools, order, parameters).

The workflows are available in the [Shared Workflows](https://cheminformatics.usegalaxy.eu/workflows/list_published), with the label "***cheminformatics***".
