    #We have an extended, 2 day downtime for Galaxy. We are re-cabling some of
    #the SGE cluster and parts of the storage. We will keep Galaxy online, but
    #access to data older than ~1 month may fail. We ask that you kindly do not
    #do any analysis of old data.

    #On tuesday (2018-03-13) from 0830 to 1130 CET there is a complete power
    #shutdown in the UFR RZ where our servers are located. We will not be able
    #to keep services on during this time so please bear with us as the compute
    #center test their power backups.
