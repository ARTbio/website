    We have an downtime with an unknown time period on wednesday, June 11th. We
    were recently informed that the University will perform mainteance
    affecting the firewall for the entire university.

    This will unfortunately take our services offline, and we have no control
    over this. We apologise for the late notice, it was not widely announced by
    the UFR Compute Center.

    We expect the downtime to last anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours.
