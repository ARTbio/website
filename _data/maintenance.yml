    #We have an unplanned downtime on today, August 14th. We
    #were recently informed that the University will perform mainteance
    #affecting the primary fileserver where we store all of the recently created
    #Galaxy datasets.

    #This *may* affect some jobs but it will be a small percentage of them.

    #We will additionally take this downtime to reconfigure the backend data
    #storage of Galaxy.
