          During an upgrade a database migration failed resulting in a downtime
          of many hours. In the end we restored the current database state from
          a backup of that hour, but the `workflow_connections` table was
          affected.

          Any workflow connections created between sunday evening (2019-03-17)
          and monday evening when the downtime happened, are lost. All of the
          other workflow edits are safe, your configuration changes, your
          addition or removal of tools, all of that data is safe. Only the
          connections between tools may be affected.

          We are now back online running Galaxy 19.01.
