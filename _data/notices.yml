          The upgrade is complete, read about [all of the awesome new features](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/latest/releases/19.05_announce_user.html)!

          The upgrade involved some unexpected downtime due to operational
          issues. The disk usage was high due to user uploads, and we had to
          kill those before the upgrade could proceed. This resulted in some
          downtime. We apoologise for any inconvenience.

          We will update Galaxy to 19.05 today. We do not expect any issues. There may be a 10-20 minute period while processes restart, that some buttons/routes do not work, but there will be no downtime.
          We have a backout plan in place should anything go wrong, but hopefully now that we have tested this upgrade in a test environment first, things will go smoothly.

          The upgrade will take place over lunch, 12-13 CEST
