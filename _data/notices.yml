        During debugging of a datatype issue, we unintentionally broke uploads.
        We are waiting on access from a second admin in order to restore

          #We have verified the patch. While updating the job configuration to a
          #newer and even safer implementation with fewer ways to fail, @erasche
          #failed to install a required dependency. Galaxy refused to load the
          #python module where our configuration was defined, and thus all jobs
          #began to fail.
