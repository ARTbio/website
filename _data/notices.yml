          We are making some changes to our DNS records as part of an ongoing
          migration to our new cloud. This should not result in more than 10
          minutes of inaccessibility.

          #We have verified the patch. While updating the job configuration to a
          #newer and even safer implementation with fewer ways to fail, @erasche
          #failed to install a required dependency. Galaxy refused to load the
          #python module where our configuration was defined, and thus all jobs
          #began to fail.
