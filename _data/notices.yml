          The freiburg compute center has reconfigured the network. This change
          resulted in our VMs that run our jobs losing internet access. As a
          result, any job which tries to download data from the internet will
          fail. Please download locally and upload via FTP (or browser) in the meantime.

          #We have verified the patch. While updating the job configuration to a
          #newer and even safer implementation with fewer ways to fail, @erasche
          #failed to install a required dependency. Galaxy refused to load the
          #python module where our configuration was defined, and thus all jobs
          #began to fail.
