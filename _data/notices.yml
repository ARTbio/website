          Galaxy is back. We hope it will be stable but we cannot make any
          guarantees. This was one of the worst failure scenarios we have seen
          in recent memory. We had plans which would have decreased the impact
          of this particular incident, but had not yet implemented them.

            We have had significant unplanned downtime today, due to numerous
            unexpected hardware and software problems spanning multiple machines.

            We are attempting to triage this to the best of our ability. We will keep
            you updated.

          #We have verified the patch. While updating the job configuration to a
          #newer and even safer implementation with fewer ways to fail, @erasche
          #failed to install a required dependency. Galaxy refused to load the
          #python module where our configuration was defined, and thus all jobs
          #began to fail.
