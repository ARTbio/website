          Things are back to normal as far as we can see. One of our two
          clusters is offline (and STAR may have issues) but it is otherwise
          functional. Please report any things you notice.

          #We have verified the patch. While updating the job configuration to a
          #newer and even safer implementation with fewer ways to fail, @erasche
          #failed to install a required dependency. Galaxy refused to load the
          #python module where our configuration was defined, and thus all jobs
          #began to fail.
