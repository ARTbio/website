          We will update Galaxy to 19.05 today. We do not expect any issues. There may be a 10-20 minute period while processes restart, that some buttons/routes do not work, but there will be no downtime.
          We have a backout plan in place should anything go wrong, but hopefully now that we have tested this upgrade in a test environment first, things will go smoothly.

          The upgrade will take place over lunch, 12-13 CEST
