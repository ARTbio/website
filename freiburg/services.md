# <i class="fa fa-server"></i> Galaxy server

Our flagship service is our Galaxy server ([https://usegalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu)) which is the **biggest Galaxy instance in Europe**, and one of the biggest worldwide.

With this server we provide access to:
- a huge compute and storage resource without any charge
- more than 1000 different, well-documented and constantly maintained bioinformatics tools.

When this effort is combined with our community-maintained workflows and our in-depth training material, it makes up for a truly productive work experience. We believe in enabling everyone to perform reproducible science.

# <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap"></i> Training

Supporting researchers by educating them in *e.g.* big data analysis, programming, data management, and Galaxy server administration, is one of our goals as we believe that **sharing of knowledge** and the **open science** movement are the key points in future.

### Workshops

In Freiburg, we already offer twice per year a full-week hands-on high-throughput sequencing data analysis workshop: Introduction to Galaxy and HTS, RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, Exome-Seq, MethylC-Seq, etc. Registrations are possible through our website.

We are also giving training around the world on demand: for data analysis but also for developers and administrators.

### Online training material at training.galaxyproject.org

The Freiburg Galaxy Team is the main contributor to the community-driven development of Galaxy training material. All of this material is **online, and freely accessible for everyone** at [https://training.galaxyproject.org](https://training.galaxyproject.org). You will find there **tutorials with hands-on, slides and interactive tours**, designed for both **self-training** and **workshops**.

We also provide the technical support with tools, data, virtualized instances, ... So you can use this material on our Galaxy instance or you can spin up your own Galaxy server!

If you want to offer a training course to other researchers, we do maintain a set of material for “train the trainers” and we are happy to share our knowledge and experience in this area with you. We are also providing training material for Galaxy developers and admins as well as the possibility to use iPython notebooks and jupyter directly in Galaxy.

### Hackathons

Hackathons or contribution fests are short events (usually few days) where people combine their force and **develop new, or improving existing techniques, tools, training materials, etc.** 

We organize numerous hackathons per year on site or online, in close cooperation with [de.NBI](http://www.denbi.de/), [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org/), and the Galaxy community.

<a name="training-infrastructure-as-a-service"></a>
# <i class="fa fa-university"></i> Training Infrastructure-as-a-Service (TIaaS)

We are very excited to offer a special service for Galaxy trainers: Training infrastructure as a Service!

If you have a training event planned, get in touch with us and we will allocate you **completely dedicated compute resources** for the duration of your training. Your users’ jobs will be directed to these resources and are free from the regular job queue. No setup, no queueing times, no hassle.

Just drop us a mail and concentrate on the important things during your training.

<a name="virtualization-for-sensitive-data"></a>
# <i class="fa fa-cube"></i> Virtualization for Sensitive Data

For sensitive (biomedical) data and users with internet limitations, we offer **virtualizations** for Galaxy and many other tools. Our aim is to enable all researchers easy access to tools, wherever they need them. 

### Virtualized deployments

Spending valuable time in compilation hell or frustrating conversations with cluster admins because tools are not available should not be a problem nowadays.

Therefore, we are leading the Bioconda ([http://bioconda.github.io](http://bioconda.github.io)) and BioContainers ([https://biocontainers.pro](https://biocontainers.pro)) projects, which together form the best stack for reproducible science ever.

### Virtualization of Galaxy and customized flavors

With the [Galaxy Docker project](https://github.com/bgruening/docker-galaxy-stable), we offer a "Galaxy in a box". It is a production-ready, scalable Galaxy instance, complete with all goodies included that makes Galaxy so popular.

To meet custom need, we also maintain and offer these Galaxy instance for download in a variety of different "flavors". For example:
- the [RNA-workbench flavour](https://github.com/bgruening/galaxy-rna-workbench) for all RNA related research
- [ASaiM](http://asaim.readthedocs.io) flavor for metagenomics
- A [flavor dedicated to epigenetic research](https://github.com/bgruening/docker-galaxy-epigenetics).

<a name="data-analysis"></a>
# <i class="fa fa-table"></i> Data analysis

You don't have time to analyse your data or have a very specialized question? Our team consists of experts in different fields (RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, metagenomics, etc).

We are eager to assist you and solve your scientific question with you! We have a long track record of solving advance NGS analysis tasks in tight collaborations with world-wide community of experimental groups.

<a name="tool-integration"></a>
# <i class="fa fa-cogs"></i> Tool integration

Do you have a scientific question and can't find the appropriate tool for it? We will put ideas into code, and then the code into Galaxy, so everyone can use it!

!["Tools available on usegalaxy.eu"]({{ "/assets/media/tools.png" | absolute_url }})

We are also maintaining, adapting and optimizing existing Galaxy tools in collaboration with Galaxy community, for example as part of the [Intergalactic Utilities Commission](https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc).

<a name="scientific-computing-cloud"></a>
# <i class="fa fa-cloud"></i> Scientific computing cloud

As part of the German Network for Bioinformatics Infrastructure [de.NBI](https://www.denbi.de), we maintain a scientific cloud for our users.

If you have special needs or require a virtualized computing environment for your research, get in touch with us and we will work with you to develop a personalised solution.
