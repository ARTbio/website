# Our projects

## Galaxy and its community

The Freiburg Galaxy team is highly involved in many projects of the Galaxy community:

- Galaxy core development and maintenance
- Tool integration into Galaxy and their maintenance through
    - [Intergalactic Utilities Commission](https://galaxyproject.org/iuc/)
    - [Bj√∂rn's repository](https://github.com/bgruening/galaxytools)
- [Galaxy Training Material](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/), a collection of Galaxy-related tutorials and its infrastructure, developed and maintained by the community
- [Galaxy Docker](https://github.com/bgruening/docker-galaxy-stable) to provide an easy distributable full-fledged Galaxy installation
- Development and maintenance of different Galaxy flavours
    - [RNA-Workbench](http://bgruening.github.io/galaxy-rna-workbench/) 
    - [ASaiM](http://asaim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for metagenomics
- Jupyter integration into Galaxy
- [GalaxyP](http://galaxyp.org) - a Galaxy communitity dedicated to develop [tools](https://github.com/galaxyproteomics/tools-galaxyp), workflows and [training material](http://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/proteomics/) for Proteomic research.
- [Galaxy Genome Annotation](https://galaxy-genome-annotation.github.io/) (GGA) is a group of projects focused on supporting genome annotation inside Galaxy

## Bioconda and Biocontainers

Spending valuable time in compilation/installation hell should not be a problem nowadays. Therefore, the Freiburg Galaxy team is leading the Bioconda ([http://bioconda.github.io](http://bioconda.github.io)) and BioContainers ([https://biocontainers.pro](https://biocontainers.pro)) projects, which together form the best stack for reproducible science ever.

Bioconda is a channel for the conda package manager specializing in bioinformatics with more than 3,000 bioinformatics packages ready to use with `conda install`. BioContainers is an open source and community-driven framework which provides system-agnostic executable environments for bioinformatics software, with more than 3,000 containers ready to use.

## HiCExplorer

[HiCExplorer](https://hicexplorer.readthedocs.io/en/documentation/) is a set of programs to process, normalize, analyze and visualize Hi-C data. It addresses the common tasks of Hi-C analysis from processing to visualization.

The Freiburg Galaxy team is involved in the maintenance and new development of HiCExplorer, and particularly its integration into Galaxy: [https://hicexplorer.usegalaxy.eu/](https://hicexplorer.usegalaxy.eu/)

## de.NBI and ELIXIR

The Freiburg Galaxy team is part of [de.NBI](http://www.denbi.de/), the German Network for Bioinformatics Infrastructure, through the [RNA Bioinformatics Center](http://www.denbi.de/rbc). Via de.NBI, the Freiburg Galaxy team is also involved in [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org), as technical coordinator for the the [German node](https://www.elixir-europe.org/about-us/who-we-are/nodes/germany).

The Freiburg Galaxy team is also co-leading the [ELIXIR Galaxy Community
](https://www.elixir-europe.org/communities/galaxy), particularly with the maintenance of European Galaxy instance: [usegalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu/).
