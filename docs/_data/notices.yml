          The temporary fix we applied contained a bug and necessitated a second patching cycle.

          We noticed that jobs were unable to be submitted to our condor
          cluster. We are working on resolving this as quickly as posisble.

          We have made an emergency patch which should correct this until we can get
          the underlying problem fixed.
