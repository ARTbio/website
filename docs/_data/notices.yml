        The temporary fix we applied contained a bug and necessitated a second patching cycle.

        We noticed that jobs were unable to be submitted to our condor
        cluster. We are working on resolving this as quickly as posisble.

        We have made an emergency patch which should correct this until we can get
        the underlying problem fixed.
