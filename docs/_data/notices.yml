          #We have verified the patch. While updating the job configuration to a
          #newer and even safer implementation with fewer ways to fail, @erasche
          #failed to install a required dependency. Galaxy refused to load the
          #python module where our configuration was defined, and thus all jobs
          #began to fail.

          #We believe the issue is now patched. Hopefully jobs should return to
          #normal very shortly. We're actively monitoring the situation

          #We noticed that jobs were unable to be submitted due to a
          #misconfiguration on our end. We are currently investigating the
          #issue.
