  abstract =	 {What does it take to convert a heap of sequencing data into 
                  a publishable result? First, common tools are employed to 
                  reduce primary data (sequencing reads) to a form suitable 
                  for further analyses (i.e., the list of variable sites). The 
                  subsequent exploratory stage is much more ad hoc and 
                  requires the development of custom scripts and pipelines, 
                  making it problematic for biomedical researchers. Here, we 
                  describe a hybrid platform combining common analysis 
                  pathways with the ability to explore data interactively. It 
                  aims to fully encompass and simplify the "raw 
                  data-to-publication" pathway and make it reproducible.}

  abstract =	 {The importance of RNA-based regulation is becoming more and 
                  more evident. Genome-wide sequencing efforts have shown that 
                  the majority of the DNA in eukaryotic genomes is 
                  transcribed. Advanced high-throughput techniques like CLIP 
                  for the genome-wide detection of RNA-protein interactions 
                  have shown that post-transcriptional regulation by 
                  RNA-binding proteins matches the complexity of 
                  transcriptional regulation. The need for a specialized and 
                  integrated analysis of RNA-based data has led to the 
                  foundation of the RNA Bioinformatics Center (RBC) within the 
                  German Network of Bioinformatics Infrastructure (de.NBI). 
                  This paper describes the tools, services and databases 
                  provided by the RBC, and shows example applications. 
                  Furthermore, we have setup an RNA workbench within the 
                  Galaxy framework. For an easy dissemination, we offer a 
                  virtualized version of Galaxy (via Galaxy Docker) enabling 
                  other groups to use our RNA workbench in a very simple way.}

  abstract =	 {RNA-based regulation has become a major research topic in 
                  molecular biology. The analysis of epigenetic and expression 
                  data is therefore incomplete if RNA-based regulation is not 
                  taken into account. Thus, it is increasingly important but 
                  not yet standard to combine RNA-centric data and analysis 
                  tools with other types of experimental data such as RNA-seq 
                  or ChIP-seq. Here, we present the RNA workbench, a 
                  comprehensive set of analysis tools and consolidated 
                  workflows that enable the researcher to combine these two 
                  worlds. Based on the Galaxy framework the workbench 
                  guarantees simple access, easy extension, flexible adaption 
                  to personal and security needs, and sophisticated analyses 
                  that are independent of command-line knowledge. Currently, 
                  it includes more than 50 bioinformatics tools that are 
                  dedicated to different research areas of RNA biology 
                  including RNA structure analysis, RNA alignment, RNA 
                  annotation, RNA-protein interaction, ribosome profiling, 
                  RNA-seq analysis and RNA target prediction. The workbench is 
                  developed and maintained by experts in RNA bioinformatics 
                  and the Galaxy framework. Together with the growing 
                  community evolving around this workbench, we are committed 
                  to keep the workbench up-to-date for future standards and 
                  needs, providing researchers with a reliable and robust 
                  framework for RNA data analysis. AVAILABILITY: The RNA 
                  workbench is available at 
                  https://github.com/bgruening/galaxy-rna-workbench.}
