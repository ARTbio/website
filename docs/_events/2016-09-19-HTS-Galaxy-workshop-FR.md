We will offer one more Galaxy workshop on HTS data analysis in 2016!

The Bioinformatics and Deep-Sequencing Unit at the MPI-IE Freiburg and the Bioinformatics group at the Department of Computer Science, ALU, offer an introductory course to the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data using the Galaxy platform.
