The Freiburg Galaxy Team is offering several services to enable reproducible, accessible science for everyone.

# Galaxy Server

Our flagship service is our Galaxy server. With the Galaxy gateway, we do offer access to a lot of compute and storage resourcs.
But not only this, Galaxy will give you access to more then 1000 of different Bioinformatics tools, all maintained and documented for you.
Combined with community maintained workflows and our training material we hope to enable everone to analys their own data in a reproducible way.

# Training

The Galaxy team in Freiburg is offering various trainings world wide.
Supporting researchers by training them in big data analysis, programming and data managment is important for us,
as we beliefe in knowledge sharing and open sciende.

As part of this the Galaxy Freiburg team is maintaining with many other people world-wide the Galaxy training material
@ https://training.galaxyproject.org. All our material is online and accessible for everyone without restictions. You can 
use this material on our Galaxy server or you can spin up your own virtualised Galaxy server - as you like!

If you want to offer a training course to other researchers, we do maintain a set of material for "train the trainers" and share our experience as much as we can.

And we have a special service for Galaxy traininers - Training-infrastructure as a Service!
You have a planned training? Get in touch with us to get dedicated resources for your training. We will guarantee that for the time of your training, all your
trainees are using resources dedicated to your training event. No setup, no queing waiting times, no hassle. Just drop us a mail and
concentrate on the important things during your training.

- Tours?


# Virtualised Deployments

Our aim is to enable all researchers easy access to tools, wherever they need them.
Spending valuable time in compilation hell or frustating conversations with cluster admins because
tools are not available should not be a problem nowadays. Therefor, we are leading the BioConda and BioContainers projects,
which are forming together the best stack for reproducible science which we ever had.

## BioConda & BioContainers

- mulled
- conda -> containers
- the entire stack is available in Galaxy, pick which technology your needs fits best.

## Galaxy flavors

We are offering access to a lot of compute and storage resources through our Galaxy portal to everyone.
The Galaxy server is our way to deliver all our services, like training, tools, data analysis, our cloud too you.

However, we do need to limit the storage capacity for a single user to offer this service to thousands of researchers.
We don't want to restrict anyone, or make anyone dependent on our service as we beliefe in freedom of research and open access in science.

For this reason we have developed a virtualised Galaxy instance, you can think of this like Galaxy in a Box. Production ready,
scalable with all goodies included that makes Galaxy so popular. We maintain and offer these Galaxy instance for download in a variaty
of different flavors. For example the RNA-workbench for all RNA related reserch, or Asaim for metagenomics or a flavor dedicated for epigenetic research.


# Data analysis

You don't have time to analysis your data or have a very specialized question? Our team consists of expert in different fields and
we are eager to assist you and solve your scientific question with you!
If we can not help you, we know many smart bioinformatians around the globe and will redirect you.

# Tool integration

You have a scientific question and don't find the appropriate tool for it? We can put ideas into code and then in Galaxy, so everyone can use it!


# Scientific computing cloud

As part of the German Network for Bioinformatics Infrastructure we maintain a scientific cloud for our users.
Do you have special needs needs? Do you need a virtualised computing environment for your research?
Get in touch with us and we will develop a personalised solution for you!
