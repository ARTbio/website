title: Genome Annotation reloaded
---

During the last month the Galaxy team has put a lot of effort into updating the Genome Annotatoin tools and include new tools
will change how you work with your Genome in silico.

We update **AntiSmash**, a tool for genome-wide identification, annotation and analysis of secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters,
to the latest version 4.1. 

**BLAST** databases and **Prokka**, a complete prokaryotic genome annotation pipeline was updated and **Roary**,
a pangenome pipeline from our Australian friends to quickly generate a core gene alignment from gff3 files was integrated as well.

**Augustus** and **Glimmer** for gene prediction and **Gubbins** for recombination detection in bacteria as well as
many others saw updates.

One tool we would like to highligh especially: [Circos](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/19/9/1639)
In collaboration with Saskia Hiltemann from Erasmus MC (Leiden University) we integrated Circos into Galaxy and finally make it
possible to create these plots automatically in a workflow and from within your browser.

Let's anotate some Genomes - Any feedback welcome!
