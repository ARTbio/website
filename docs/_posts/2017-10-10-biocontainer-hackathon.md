---

Bj√∂rn participated to the [BioContainer Hackathon](https://github.com/BioContainers/workshops/blob/master/README.md) organized in Paris. The purpose of this event was to consolidate a the [BioContainers](https://biocontainers.pro/) Platform as a Service, and the integration with other groups like Workflows & workbenches and Software tools ([Bio.Tools](https://bio.tools/)).

During these two days, BioConda packages has been created and the 3,000 container threshold has been passed. As planned, effort was put on integration of Bio.Tools with BioContainers. Training (about using containers, docker and Singularity) was also an important part of this successful hackathon.
