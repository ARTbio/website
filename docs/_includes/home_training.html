        <p>We, at the Freiburg Galaxy Team, are caring about training.</p>

        <p>Twice a year, we are organizing a week of workshop on NGS data analyses here in Freiburg. 
        Parallely, we are also regularly giving training around the world on data analyses and 
        also on development and administration of Galaxy. You can check our 
        <a href="{{site.url}}/{{base.url}}/events">events</a> to find our next workshop.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, we can not fill all the demand in training. We offer 
        training materials, accessible online at <a href="http://training.galaxyproject.org">http://training.galaxyproject.org</a></p>
