The first [Galaxy conference](http://galaxyafrica.sanbi.ac.za/) was held last week in Africa, organized by [SANBI](http://www.sanbi.ac.za/) at [University of Wester Cape](https://www.uwc.ac.za/Pages/default.aspx) in Cape Town. Björn and Bérénice participated:

- On the 3rd, Björn gave the keynote talk ("Welcome to Galaxy") in the morning. During the afternoon, they gave a Galaxy introduction training
- On the 4th, Bérénice started with the keynote talk (["Welcome to Galaxy"](http://bebatut.fr/talks/18/04_04_galaxy_africa/#/1))

- On the last day, Björn gave an admin training with Enis Afgan and Bérénice a metagenomic training. 

These 3 days were quite intense with a lot of talks and interesting discussions and feedbacks. It was a great opportunity to meet the growing community in Africa (44 participants, 7 countries, 12 institutions) and talk about Galaxy and accessible, reproducible analysis of biological data.
