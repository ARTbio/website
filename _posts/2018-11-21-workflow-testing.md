We have started to test a few of our workflows automatically against [UseGalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu).
This will run all workflows monthly to ensure that the keep working and that our infrastructure works and scales well.

Feel free to contribute workflows to our [testing repository](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/workflow-testing) or
propose us workflows via contact@usegalaxy.eu.
