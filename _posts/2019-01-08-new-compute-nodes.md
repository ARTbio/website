Today we activated our brand new hardware. Thanks to the [Federal Ministry of Education and Research](https://www.bmbf.de/en/) we could extend the
[de.NBI-Cloud](https://www.denbi.de/cloud) with 8x1TB nodes. This means more high-memory nodes for your memory intensive jobs, less waiting, faster results.
Enjoy!
