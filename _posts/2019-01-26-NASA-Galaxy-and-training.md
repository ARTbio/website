[Dave B](https://galaxyproject.org/people/dave-bouvier/){:target="_blank"} pointed us to this nice article about
"Exploring the Effects of Spaceflight on Mouse Physiology using the Open Access NASA GeneLab Platform".

Turns out the "Open Access NASA GeneLab Platform" is a Galaxy and they are referencing the [Galaxy project Training Material](http://training.galaxyproject.org/){:target="_blank"}.

NASA and the Galaxy - what a nice match!
