This 2 day workshops was organized and hosted by the [Institute of Nuclear Sciences Vinča](http://bg.ac.rs/en/members/institutes/Vinca.php) in Belgrade. Björn, Helena and Bérénice offered there an introductory course to Galaxy and RNA-seq data analysis to 50 participants. 

The participants seem to have appreciated this workshop, given the nice feedback we got.
